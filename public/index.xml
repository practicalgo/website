      <description>Hello everyone. &amp;ldquo;Practical Go: Building Scalable Network and Non-Network Applications&amp;rdquo; is now out electronically as well as in print.
The book targets readers who have learned the Go language basics - syntax, understanding of types, being able to write functions (details are available in the &amp;ldquo;Getting started&amp;rdquo; chapter - but essentially, just a passing familiarity with the language is enough I think). I say that and reasonably confidently since that&amp;rsquo;s where I was when I started writing this book.</description>
