        <h1>Hello world</h1><time>December 22, 2021</time></header><p>Hello everyone. &ldquo;Practical Go: Building Scalable Network and Non-Network Applications&rdquo; is now out
electronically as well as in print.</p>
<p>The book targets readers who have learned the Go language basics - syntax, understanding of types,
being able to write functions (details are available in the &ldquo;Getting started&rdquo; chapter - but essentially,
just a passing familiarity with the language is enough I think). I say that and reasonably confidently
since that&rsquo;s where I was when I started writing this book. I wrote this book, not to share with you things
I already knew - far from it. The book is essentially a documentation of my journey of learning Go and applying
it to solve problems which I think based on my experience are being solved by folks in the industry a.k.a
real world today.</p>
<p>The book consists of 11 chapters, a Getting Started guide and two Appendices.</p>
<p>In Getting Started, I guide you through the installation of the software required for the book. I also discuss some of the assumed knowledge for the following chapters.</p>
<p>In Chapters 1 and 2, I show how to write command line applications using the standard library’s flag package.</p>
<p>In Chapters 3 and 4, I show how you can write robust HTTP clients, using the standard library’s net/http package and friends.</p>
<p>In Chapters 5, 6 and 7, I show how you can build production ready HTTP servers using net/http
and related packages from the standard library.</p>
<p>In Chapters 8, 9 and 10, I show how you can build production ready gRPC applications using the Go gRPC implementation.</p>
<p>In Chapter 11, I show how you can work with two categories of data stores - Object store and a SQL data store using the <a href="https://gocloud.dev">https://gocloud.dev</a> library.</p>
<p>In Apendix A, you will learn to implement instrumentation in applications to emit telemetry data - Logs, Metrics, and Traces.</p>
<p>In Appendix B, you will learn to read configuration data in your application, learn to build a container image for your application and get some guidance around deploying your applications.</p>
<p>You can find a detailed table of contents here: <a href="https://practicalgobook.net/toc/">https://practicalgobook.net/toc/</a> along with a link to an excerpt of Chapter 1.
Any further questions, let me know, i will be happy to answer!</p>

<p>In the next post, I will share how this website is hosted! Hint: it&rsquo;s a Go HTTP Server.</p>
