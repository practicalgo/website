The errata page has also been updated with a new error reported.

      <description>I write my blog posts in Markdown format, and then use Hugo static site generator to generate HTML files. The topic of this blog post is how those HTML files are served to you.
If you happened to come across my GopherCon 2021 lightning talk, this blog post describes the topic in all the gory detail!

      <description>Hello everyone. &amp;ldquo;Practical Go: Building Scalable Network and Non-Network Applications&amp;rdquo; is now out electronically as well as in print.
The book targets readers who have learned the Go language basics - syntax, understanding of types, being able to write functions (details are available in the &amp;ldquo;Getting started&amp;rdquo; chapter - but essentially, just a passing familiarity with the language is enough I think). I say that and reasonably confidently since that&amp;rsquo;s where I was when I started writing this book.</description>
