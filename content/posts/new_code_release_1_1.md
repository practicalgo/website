I have published a new version of the source code accompanying the book.

You can find the v1.0.1 release [here](https://github.com/practicalgo/code/releases/tag/v1.0.1).

I am extremely thankful to the folks who reported and participated in the issues
and pull requests.

The [errata](https://practicalgobook.net/errata/) page has also been updated
with a new error reported.

If you find a bug or missing source code, please file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/practicalgo/code/issues)
