I write my blog posts in Markdown format,  and then use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site 
generator to generate HTML files. The topic of this blog post is how those HTML files are served
to you. 

If you happened to come across my [GopherCon 2021 lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6VnTM1f2cc),
this blog post describes the topic in all the gory detail!

## Background

When you type in https://practicalgobook.net in your browser (or click it from somewhere), a translation,
commonly known as DNS resolution happens. As a result of this translation, the browser gets back
an IP address:

```
# Ran this command on a Linux system
$ dig +short practicalgobook.net # this is a command to perform DNS resolution
172.105.175.12
```

This IP address refers to a virtual machine running in the cloud. As of a few months back, I am running this
virtual machine on a cloud provider. When the browser's request reaches this virtual machine, 
a **program** then sends back the HTML files that were generated by Hugo. This program is 
written using the Go programming language. I use the standard libraries and two third party packages 
for implementing advanced features. 

Let's dive in!

## Content delivery - Proof of Concept

The first working iteration of the server looked as follows:

```go
package main

import (
	"embed"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)

//go:embed posts code
//go:embed index.html index.xml sitemap.xml
//go:embed categories css images
var siteData embed.FS

func main() {
	listenAddr := ":80"
	if len(os.Getenv("LISTEN_ADDR")) != 0 {
		listenAddr = os.Getenv("LISTEN_ADDR")

	}
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	staticFileServer := http.FileServer(http.FS(siteData))
	mux.Handle("/", staticFileServer)

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, mux))
}
```

The key standard libraries used in this iteration were [embed](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) and [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http).

The `embed` package allowed me build an executable Go application containing all the blog content. As you can see in the `//go:embed`
directives, I include all the directories that `hugo` generated in the default, `public` directory inside the application as
a variable `siteData` of [embed.FS](https://pkg.go.dev/embed#FS) type.

Once this was done, I use the [http.FileServer](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#FileServer) handler to serve the files that were embedded
and available to the application via the `siteData` variable.

`http.FileServer` expects an argument of a type which implements the [http.FileSystem](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#FileSystem) interface.

`siteData` which is of type `embed.FS` implements the [fs.FS](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS) interface and hence, we use the [http.FS](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#FS) function to convert `siteData` to a value of type `http.FileSystem` and thus, we have the following code snippet above:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
staticFileServer := http.FileServer(http.FS(siteData))
mux.Handle("/", staticFileServer)
```

Then, we call the `ListenAndServe()` function to start the HTTP server on the address specified in `listenAddr`.

To summarize, at this stage, I had:

- I a Go server containing all my blog's files. All I had to do is build my application and copy it to the host using `scp`. I didn't need to copy the contents separately! My blog was *just* an executable.
- It ran on address specified, `:8080` which I specified via `LISTEN_ADDR` environment variable
- I used a cloud provider's load balancer to give me free HTTPS, which means, I had https://practicalgobook.net website working (Traffic flow: Browser -> Load balancer -> Go server (running on port 8080)

Next, I set out to implement support for making the website acessible over HTTPS and without paying for the very expensive load balancer.

## Content Delivery - Caddy as a reverse proxy

During this stage, I made a couple of changes:

- I stopped using the cloud provider's load balancer as it was proving too expensive
- I pointed the DNS record of practicalgobook.net to a self-managed virtual machine

Hence, I would need a way to manage the TLS certificates on the virtual machine myself.

I knew that I am going to use https://letsencrypt.org/ for TLS certificates. I considered managing TLS certificates in the Go server itself using one of the options listed [here](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/#clients-go). However, quickly realizing it may not be a battle for the day, 
I gave Caddy a go.

I installed [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install#fedora-redhat-centos) on my CentOS VM, and wrote the following `Caddyfile`:

```
practicalgobook.net {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
        handle_errors {
	     respond "I will be back soon!"
        }
}
```
And that's it! I started `caddy` using the systemd service, started my Go application using a systemd service and I had HTTPS working again without
the expense of running a cloud managed load balancer.

To summarize, at this stage, I had:

- I have a Go server containing all my blog's files. All I had to do is build my application and copy it to the host using `scp`. I didn't need to copy the contents separately! My blog was *just* an executable.
- It ran on address specified, `:8080` which I specified via `LISTEN_ADDR` environment variable
- I used Caddy which ran on port 443 and port 80 to give me free HTTPS and forwarded traffic to the Go server on port 8080. I had https://practicalgobook.net website working (Traffic flow: Browser -> Virtual Machine -> Caddy (443) -> Go server (running on port 8080)
- No third party libraries

I was happy with the progress at this stage, but then I found an issue.

When I wanted to update my blog, I had to stop and start my application manually and which meant there was downtime.

And considering that this is a very important website, I couldn't have that. So I set out to fix that.

## Automating restart on updates

My first plan was, "yeah, I will create a new executable and simply overwrite the existing one in place and then find a way to reload it".
You can't, you will get a "Text file busy" error as [explained here](http://wiki.wlug.org.nz/ETXTBSY). Now, of course, even if I could copy
it in place, reloading itself would need some work, notable have a way to indicate to the program and "please reload yourself". And that
exploration led me to [slayer/autorestart](https://github.com/slayer/autorestart) package and I integrated it as follows:

```
package main

import (
	"embed"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"github.com/slayer/autorestart"
)

//go:embed buy categories code css images posts support tags toc
//go:embed book_cover.jpg go.mod index.html index.xml sitemap.xml
var siteData embed.FS

func main() {
	listenAddr := ":8080"
	if len(os.Getenv("LISTEN_ADDR")) != 0 {
		listenAddr = os.Getenv("LISTEN_ADDR")

	}
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	staticFileServer := http.FileServer(http.FS(siteData))
	mux.Handle("/", staticFileServer)

	// Notifier
	restart := autorestart.GetNotifier()
	go func() {
		<-restart
		log.Printf("Detected change in binary. Restarting.")
	}()

	autorestart.StartWatcher()
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, mux))
}
```

At this stage, my blog updates looked like:

```bash
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build
$ scp server root@<ip-address>:/usr/local/bin/practicalgo-website-1
$ ssh root@ip mv /usr/local/bin/practicalgo-website-1 /usr/local/bin/practicalgo-website
```

I get around the "Text file busy" error by creating a temporary file and then using the `mv` command which uses
the atomic [rename()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7054844/is-rename-atomic#7054851) system call.

And thanks to `slayer/autorestart`, my application reloads itself and my new content becomes available to the world wide web!

To summarize, at this stage, I had:

- I have a Go server containing all my blog's files. All I had to do is build my application and copy it to the host using `scp`. I didn't need to copy the contents separately! My blog was *just* an executable.
- It ran on address specified, `:8080` which I specified via `LISTEN_ADDR` environment variable
- I used Caddy which ran on port 443 and port 80 to give me free HTTPS and forwarded traffic to the Go server on port 8080. I had https://practicalgobook.net website working (Traffic flow: Browser -> Virtual Machine -> Caddy (443) -> Go server (running on port 8080)
- Using [slayer/autorestart](https://github.com/slayer/autorestart), I had implemented an automatically updating running server

However, for the automatic update to be running, the old process was being terminated and a new process being created, which meant, 
connections were being dropped and that is simply not an option. 

So, time to fix that.

## Zero downtime updates

Now, I "knew" that on Linux, network sockets are file descriptors and that you child processes inherit parent's opened file descriptors. 
But I didn't know enough to  implement it myself. From the README of `slayer/autorestart`, I saw a reference to an unmaintained project 
[facebookgo/grace](https://github.com/facebookgo/grace) which seemed very relevant to what I was looking for. So, I integrated my server with
the `grace/gracehttp` package:

```go
package main

import (
	"embed"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"github.com/facebookgo/grace/gracehttp"
	"github.com/slayer/autorestart"
)

//go:embed buy categories code css images posts support tags toc
//go:embed book_cover.jpg go.mod index.html index.xml sitemap.xml
var siteData embed.FS

func main() {
	logger := log.New(os.Stdout, "INFO: ", log.Lshortfile)
	listenAddr := ":8080"
	if len(os.Getenv("LISTEN_ADDR")) != 0 {
		listenAddr = os.Getenv("LISTEN_ADDR")

	}
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	staticFileServer := http.FileServer(http.FS(siteData))
	mux.Handle("/", staticFileServer)

	srv := http.Server{
		Addr:    listenAddr,
		Handler: mux,
	}

	autorestart.RestartFunc = autorestart.SendSIGUSR2
	restart := autorestart.GetNotifier()
	go func() {
		<-restart
		logger.Printf("Detected change in binary. Restarting.")
	}()

	autorestart.StartWatcher()

	gracehttp.SetLogger(logger)
	logger.Fatalf("Server terminating: %v", gracehttp.Serve(&srv))
}

```

I alluded to running the Go server as a systemd service above, here's the systemd service file:

```
[Unit]
Description=Practical Go Website

[Service]
Environment="LISTEN_ADDR=:8080"
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/practicalgo-website
User=nobody

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

I also added in systemd socket activation for my server using the following
`.socket` file:

```
[Socket]
ListenStream = 8080
BindIPv6Only = both

[Install]
WantedBy = sockets.target
```

The summary of the above changes results in the following behavior:

- When a request comes in, and if my application is not already running, systemd will automatically start it (thanks to socket activation!)
- When `slayer/autorestart` detects a change in binary, it sends itself the `SIGUSR2` signal
- `facebook/grace/gracehttp`, upon getting this signal activates its machinery of ensuring that the new process's underlying TCP 
  listeners are created from the already opened file descriptors and thus ensuring no current HTTP requests are dropped
  
Thus, as it stands today:

- I have a Go server containing all my blog's files. All I had to do is build my application and copy it to the host using `scp`. I didn't need to copy the contents separately! My blog was *just* an executable.
- It ran on address specified, `:8080` which I specified via `LISTEN_ADDR` environment variable
- I used Caddy which ran on port 443 and port 80 to give me free HTTPS and forwarded traffic to the Go server on port 8080. I had https://practicalgobook.net website working (Traffic flow: Browser -> Virtual Machine -> Caddy (443) -> Go server (running on port 8080)
- Using [slayer/autorestart](https://github.com/slayer/autorestart), I had implemented an automatically updating running server
- Using [systemd socket activation](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html) and [facebookgo/grace/gracehttp](https://github.com/facebookarchive/grace/tree/master/gracehttp), I have a zero-downtime server application.

## Summary

In the book, we make heavy use of `net/http` standard library package and I allude to how useful the
`embed` package can be. I hope you found this post useful and showed you a practical way to use them together. As I mentioned in my [GopherCon 2021 lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6VnTM1f2cc), there was no problem to solve here, but it proved to be a very fulfilling learning exercise for me.
While writing this post, especially, the last section, I sensed a disconnect in my understanding between why I needed the socket activation, other
than the initial automatic startup of the server. Was it also needed for the graceful restart? I will need to dig in a bit more again. 

You can find the source code for the server in the file, [server.go](https://github.com/practicalgo/website/blob/main/public/server.go) and other
resources that are needed to deploy [here](https://github.com/practicalgo/website/tree/main/deploy-resources).

If you are curious to learn more systemd socket activation and Go applications, please refer this post: https://mgdm.net/weblog/systemd-socket-activation/.

Finally, I got very curious about how `facebook/grace/gracehttp` worked and was able to implement a proof of concept myself only for TCP network sockets from 
scratch. Here's some code, without any documentation [here](https://github.com/amitsaha/go-tcp-handover). 

I have a plan to replace my use of both the third party libraries with my code for this server.
